Sprunger, C., S.W. Culman, A.L. Peralta, S.T. DuPont, J.T. Lennon, and S.S. Snapp (In review) Perennial grain crop roots and nitrogen management shape soil food webs and soil carbon dynamics.

## We address the following questions

* **Aim 1.)**: How does perenniality and different N management influence roots, soil carbon pools, and soil food webs?

* **Aim 2.)**: In what ways could a perennial grain crop positively impact soil carbon stabilization and food web structure and function?


### Repo Contents
